<h2>
    Ingredients:</h2>
<div style="text-align: left;"><img src="pasta.jpeg" width="300" alt="My Image" /></div>
<ul>
   <li> 8 ounces dried fettuccine pasta</li>
   <li> 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 pound total)</li>
    <li>  1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
<li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
<li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) European-style unsalted butter, divided</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
</ul>
<h3> Instructions : </h3>
<ol>
   <li> Cook the pasta, drain, and reserve cooking water.</li> <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li> <li>Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
<li>Dry the chicken and season with salt and pepper.</li> <li>Meanwhile, pat both sides of the chicken breasts dry with paper towels.</li>
    <li>Season with 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper.</li>
<li>Heat the oil over medium-high in a large frying pan. </li>
   <li> Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until shimmering, 2 to 3 minutes. If you have a pan that has straight sides, here's the time to use it. Do not use a nonstick pan.</li>
<li>Add the chicken to the hot pan, and cook for 5 to 7 minutes.</li> <li>Swirl the pan just before adding the chicken to distribute the oil.</li> <li>Add the chicken and leave it alone for 5 to 7 minutes, until the bottom is golden-brown. If you try to to turn the chicken and it feels stuck, it isn't ready to flip.</li>
<li>Flip the chicken and cook for another 5 to 7 minutes, until the chicken reaches 165°F.</li> <li>Flip the chicken over and add 1 tablespoon of the butter right between them. Pick up the pan and give it a gentle swirl to distribute the melting butter.</li> <li>Cook the chicken until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F, 5 to 7 minutes more.</li>
<li>Slice the chicken and cover to keep warm.</li> <li>Transfer the chicken to a plate or clean cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes.</li> <li>Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Cover with aluminum foil while you prepare the rest of the dish.</li>
<li>Melt the rest of the butter and saute the garlic.</li> <li>Add the remaining 7 tablespoons butter to the same pan used for the chicken and place over medium heat until melted.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic and sauté until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
<li>Make the Alfredo sauce. Whisk in the cream, Parmesan, nutmeg, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper.</li> <li>Simmer for 3 to 4 minutes. If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.</li>
<li>Add the drained pasta and toss to coat in the sauce. Add the drained fettuccine to the sauce and toss to coat.</li> <li>Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
